## How It Works

This project was built entirely in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and published via GitHub.

**Steps:**

1. Queried OpenStreetMap using `osmnx` for nightlife tags  
2. Filtered and cleaned location data  
3. Plotted over 2,700 venues with `matplotlib`  
4. Labeled key cultural neighborhoods  
5. Exported a high-resolution PNG
